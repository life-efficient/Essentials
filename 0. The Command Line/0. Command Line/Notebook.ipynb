    "\n",
    "> Windows is OS created by Microsoft and widely used for day to day usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- Widely used for day-to-day non-professional usage\n",
    "- Supported by large company\n",
    "- Easy to use out of the box\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Closed source__ - source code of Windows is not available as it is __compiled__\n",
    "- __Non-free__ - one has to buy this OS\n",
    "- On average worse support by open source software (which we will use)\n",
    "- Hard to modify and tune for our own needs\n",
    "- Few professional software developers use it so less support may be available from people around you\n",
    "- Has a different terminal (powershell) by default\n",

    "### MacOS (fine)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good open source software support (initially based on open source project FreeBSD)\n",
    "- Supported by large company\n",
    "- Easy to use out of the box\n",
    "- Quite modifiable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",

    "- __Closed source__ - current source of MacOS is not available as it is __compiled__\n",

    "#### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open source kernel, code is available (see [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux))\n",
    "- Good open source software support (most of the open source tools are created with this OS in mind)\n",

    "- Easy to use out of the box\n",
    "- Quite modifiable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "- __No direct support from large company__, but many companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple are part of the foundation helping with Linux development (and their software usually runs on it)\n",
    "- __Less intuitive__ - although many Linux distros have really similar UIs to Windows & MacOS, some thing work a little differently (e.g. package managers)\n",

    "\n",
    "There are a few Linux distros you might try out, depending on the following factors:\n",
    "- __How much time you have to install, setup it and maintain__\n",
    "- __How much you are willing to learn about it__\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three distributions you might think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Ubuntu__ ([link here](https://ubuntu.com/download)) - easy to use, stable, less configurable, good for day-to-day usage and fine for programming (__encouraged__)\n",
    "- __Manjaro__ ([link here](https://manjaro.org/)) - easy to use, harder to maintain, bleeding edge software, good for programming, modifiable, __requires more time__\n",
    "- __Arch Linux__ ([link here](https://archlinux.org/)) - __hard to setup, maintain__, __requires a lot of work__, but modifiable to the bone. One has to build it starting only with command line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual machines (discouraged)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Virtual machines allows us to run one operating system within another\n",
    "\n",
    "You may try this approach if you don't want to:\n",
    "- Remove your current Windows installation\n",
    "- Install Linux side by side with Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Why not just do it?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works slower (two operating systems have to run at once)\n",
    "- Sometimes may crash or hang (depending on virtualization software)\n",
    "- Takes up memory resources as it will require you to partition your device (allocate a large portion of memory to one OS, so it can't be used by the other)"
